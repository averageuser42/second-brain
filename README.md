Hey there, 

I wanted to take a deep dive into AD, so I used GOAD for this purpose. Since Maylfy's walkthrough is amazing, I used it as study material. Since some of the software used in the walkthrough has been updated, I updated the commands in the walkthrough. In general, I haven't changed the text provided by Mayfly because it's an excellent source of knowledge. I added some minor remarks here and there. I would like to thank him for providing all of this material. 

I used a standard GOAD setup with docker provisioning as of this year. The attack machine is Kali 2025.2.
